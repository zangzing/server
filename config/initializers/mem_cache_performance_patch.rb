  # If a socket error (SocketError, SystemCallError, IOError, Timeout) or protocol error
  # (MemCacheError) is raised by the block, closes the socket, attempts to
  # connect again, and retries the block (once).  If an error is again raised,
  # reraises it as MemCacheError.
  #
  # If unable to connect to the server (or if in the reconnect wait period),
  # raises MemCacheError.  Note that the socket connect code marks a server
  # dead for a timeout period, so retrying does not apply to connection attempt
  # failures (but does still apply to unexpectedly lost connections etc.).
