        # full rails app but it returns with context telling the eventmachine code what to do.
        #
        # This is setup similar to the nginx_redirect approach using the X-Accel-Redirect header.  In this case however
        # we redirect internally to our internal eventmachine handlers where the proxied work can
        # take place.
