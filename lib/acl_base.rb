# exception classes for ACL

# the arguments passed are invalid

end

# this is a base container class that holds a single id and role value
# for a given ACL Type
# it is used when we want to get a list of objects that are associated
# with a particular user such as all my Albums and my role
class BaseACLTuple
  attr_accessor :acl_id, :role
end


# this is the base ACL management class - it provides the low level
# interfaces to redis to perform ACL operations.  You should inherit
# this to create a specific type of ACL.  For instance you might have
# an ACL on Albums and maybe later on some other type of object that
# you want to control
#
#
# We use redis sorted sets to hold two key lists.  The first list
# is tied to a specific object of a specific type.  So for instance
# we would have a key for a specific album that lets us track all the
# users along with their roles (through the order value).
#
# Along side the object acl we have a second user tracking list that
# has an individual user and all the ACLs they track for a specific
# type of object such as Album.  Below I show examples that talk about
# albums specifically but we are general purpose and new types can
# be added in the future through class inheritance.  Today we only
# have a child class type of AlbumACL.
#
# Having two synchronized lists allows us to efficiently ask questions
# like:
#
# 1) What is the specific role of this user on a particular album.
#
# 2) Does this user have rights to be a specific role with inheritance.
# For instance, if I am an admin and you are checking for viewer rights
# the request will be granted.  On the other hand if you are a viewer
# and we ask for admin rights it will not be permitted.
#
# 3) Show me all the admins, contribs, viewers for an object.  You can
# match based on inheritance as in #2 or specific as in #1.
#
# 4) Show me all the albums that a specific user has a role for and what
# those roles are.
#
# 5) Ask for a subset of objects for a given type that match a specific
# role filter.  Such as show me all my objects that I am an admin for.

  # an email or the numerical id.  If you use an email
  # you should call global_replace_user_key once you have

  # have both email and user id.  This way the transition point
  # becomes as soon as we have a user id we always use that.

  # ACLManager.global_replace_user_key

  # changing the user key can affect more than one ACL Type
