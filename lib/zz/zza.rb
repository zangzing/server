module ZZ
  # This module is self contained and includes all the management and
  # data delivery functionality for delivering ZZA events to the ZZA
  # server.
  #
  # It supports persistent events that can survive across any ZZA server
  # outages as it queues small batches of files for future delivery
  # inside its working directory.  It is thread safe and can operate
  # properly with multiple senders.  This simplifies the runtime requirements
  # since you don't have to have a separate worker process to send the data.
  # As long as there is at least one sender thread running somewhere in the
  # system the messages will get delivered eventually.
  #

  # this is the worker thread responsible for delivering the events to
  # the ZZA server.  This should be created as a singleton
  # since there should only be one of these per
  # process.  This is created by initialization code in this class.
  # You can also initialize it with ZZ::ZZA.initialize which will create it.
  #
  # You can also call the ZZA.default_zza_id= method which will ensure
  # you get a default zza_id set and will initialize if not already done
  # If a sender has already been created the existing one will be used.
  # This way, we always keep just one copy running.
  #
  # This class also provides the thread safe primitives for batching the
  # requests created by the ZZA class so that multiple ZZA instances can
  # share common output files and benefit by the flush timers to batch
  # requests.
