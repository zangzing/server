	<H1>ZangZing PLACE HOLDER FOR Terms of Service</H1>
	<P ><STRONG>THIS PAGE IS JUST A PLACE HOLDER FOR THE ACTUAL TERMS OF SERVICE</STRONG></P>
	<H2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF ZangZing TERMS</H2>

	<P>Welcome to ZangZing. By using ZangZing, you agree to these  
	Terms and you further agree to comply with the 
	ZangZing Community Guidelines (Community Guidelines) </P>
	<P>ZangZing LLC ("ZangZing") reserves the right to update and change, from time to time, 
	these  Terms and all documents incorporated by reference. You can 
	always find the most recent version of this  Terms and the most recent 
	version of the ZangZing Terms of Service at the URL indicated above.</P>
	<H2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</H2>
	<H3>2.1 ZangZing</H3>
	<P>Please click on the following link to learn what  features ZangZing 
	 provides to subscribers <A href="http://ZangZing.com/help/limits/#28">http://ZangZing.com/help/limits/#28</A> 
	</P>

	<H2>3. ZangZing ID AND ZangZing WALLET REQUIREMENT</H2>
	<P>To participate in the Service, you must have a valid ZangZing ID. You must also 
	have a ZangZing Wallet, which will save your credit card, billing and shipping 
	information and other information (your "Registration Data"). If you do not have 
	a ZangZing ID or a ZangZing Wallet, you will be prompted to complete the 
	registration process for them before you can pay for the Services. </P>
	<P>To use ZangZing Wallet, you must provide true, accurate, and current 
	Registration Data and keep that information accurate. You, and not ZangZing, are 
	responsible for any and all purchases made through your ZangZing Wallet account or 
	in connection with your ZangZing ID. ZangZing is not responsible for unauthorized 
	purchases or errors made using your ZangZing ID or your ZangZing Wallet account. You 
	must resolve purchase-related disputes with and promptly report unauthorized use 
	of your card to your credit card company, online payment service, merchant, or 
	bank. Your liability for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your 
	card issuer's agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the 
	uses of account information authorized by the TOS, ZangZing may access, preserve, 
	monitor and disclose your card information in the good faith belief that such 
	action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, to identify or resolve 
	problems, or to respond to inquiries about the Service, provided, however, that 
	nothing in this section shall impose a duty on ZangZing to make any such 
	disclosures. </P>
	<H2>4. PAYMENT TERMS</H2>
	<H3>4.1 General Terms</H3>
	<P>The current fee for the Service you have selected will automatically and 
	immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date that 
	you click on the "Purchase Order" button in the ordering process. Fees charged 
	for one Service may not be credited towards other services. All currency 
	references are in U.S. dollars.</P>
	<H3>4.2 Payment for Subscription</H3>
	<P>Payment occurs on a pre-pay basis and payment will not be automatically 
	renewed at the end of the term. The amount you are to pay will depend upon which 
	term of subscription you choose. For example, if you choose one year of ZangZing 
	pro, you will be charged for the one year price upfront. If you choose the two 
	year term of ZangZing, you will be charged for the entire two year price 
	upfront. Please note: If you have received a Free Period, then you will not 
	be charged for those days covered by the Free Period. You will be contacted 
	in order to renew your ZangZing account prior to the end of any expiration of 
	the account (either the expiration of a Free Period or a paid ZangZing 
	term), at which point you may elect to purchase a new ZangZing term. If you do 
	not elect to purchase a new ZangZing term, your account will automatically 
	revert to a free ZangZing account upon the expiration of your ZangZing term or 
	Free Period and will be subject to the limitations of a free ZangZing 
	account.</P>

	<H3>4.4 Account Updater</H3>
	<P>As a convenience to its users, ZangZing subscribes to a third party service 
	that can refresh expired credit card or debit card numbers with the numbers of 
	replacement cards so that users' paid Services do not lapse because the payment 
	instrument initially on file with ZangZing has expired ("Account Updater"). By 
	registering for the Service, you consent to ZangZing's disclosure of your 
	registration information to this third party service and to that service's use 
	of such information solely in connection with Account Updater. You also consent 
	to ZangZing's receipt and use of updated credit card or debit card account 
	information from your financial institution in connection with the provision of 
	the Service as provided in the TOS, these  Terms, and the ZangZing 
	Privacy Policy. </P>
	<H3>4.5 Fraud Protections</H3>
	<P>To protect against potential fraud, ZangZing may take steps to verify the 
	validity of the credit card information you provide to us. The verification 
	process may include debiting an amount between $0.01 and $0.99 from your credit 
	card account and then immediately crediting the same amount back to your credit 
	card, as well as asking you to verify the amount debited in order to confirm 
	that you are in possession of your credit card. ZangZing will only use this 
	process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card 
	account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the 
	Service. By providing ZangZing with your credit card information, you authorize 
	ZangZing to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than one 
	dollar for such verification purposes.</P>
	<H3>4.6 Cancellation of Subscription</H3>
	<P>Please note, unless ZangZing gives notice to the contrary, payment for 
	subscriptions are non-refundable. If you cancel your subscription before the end 
	of the term for which you paid, your cancellation will take effect immediately 
	and you will not be given any refund.</P>
	<H3>4.7 Termination</H3>
	<P>If your credit card is invalid for any reason, your ZangZing account will 
	revert to a free ZangZing account and will be subject to the limitations of a free 
	ZangZing account; provided, however, that ZangZing reserves the right to cancel your 
	account entirely in such case, whereupon all the information and content 
	contained within it will be deleted permanently. ZangZing accepts no liability for 
	information or content that is deleted due to an invalid credit card.</P>
	<H2>5. ZangZing'S RESERVATION OF RIGHTS</H2>

	<P>ZangZing expressly reserves the right to immediately modify, delete content 
	from, suspend or terminate your account and refuse current or future use of any 
	ZangZing service, including ZangZing, if ZangZing, in its sole discretion believes 
	you have: (i) violated or tried to violate the rights of others; or (ii) acted 
	inconsistently with the spirit or letter of the TOS, the Community Guidelines or 
	these  Terms. In such event, your ZangZing account may be suspended 
	or cancelled immediately in our discretion, all the information and content 
	contained within it deleted permanently and you will not be entitled to any 
	refund of any of the amounts you've paid for such account. ZangZing accepts no 
	liability for information or content that is deleted.</P>
	<H2>6. INDEMNITY</H2>
	<P>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ZangZing, and its subsidiaries, 
	affiliates, officers, agents, or other partners, and employees, from any claim 
	or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to 
	or arising out of your use of and access to ZangZing, your violation of the 
	TOS, these  Terms or the Community Guidelines, your violation of any 
	rights of another person or entity, or your violation of any applicable laws or 
	regulations.</P>
	<H2>7. PRIVACY</H2>
	<P>Registration Data and certain other information about you are subject to our 
	Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full privacy policy at <A

	<H2>9. OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL</H2>

	<P>You understand that by using ZangZing, you may encounter content that may 
	be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be

	<P></P>
	<H2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</H2>
	<P>Certain ZangZing services allow the purchase of gift certificates, in which the 
	cost of a subscription to that service may be given to another user as a gift. 
	ZangZing Gift Certificates can only be purchased on the ZangZing site, and a 
	particular gift certificate may only be applied toward the purchase of the 
	ZangZing service for which it is being offered.</P>
	<P>Gift certificates can be purchased in set amounts to enable the recipient to 
	receive the ZangZing service for which the gift certificate is made available by 
	ZangZing. ZangZing Gift Certificates may not be used to purchase other ZangZing Gift 
	Certificates or any other ZangZing Services or ZangZing Gift Certificates.</P>
	<H2>3. ELIGIBILITY</H2>
	<P>A ZangZing Gift Certificate may only be sold to persons above the age of 13. 
	ZangZing reserves the right to restrict the availability of a ZangZing Gift 
	Certificate to residents of certain U.S. states, with or without notice. 
	<P>A ZangZing Gift Certificate is intended for use as a gift to an individual. A 
	ZangZing Gift Certificate is non-transferable, and resale of a ZangZing Gift 
	Certificate or use for unauthorized advertising, marketing, sweepstakes or other 
	promotional purposes is strictly prohibited. You agree that ZangZing has the right 
	to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future 
	use of gift certificates and balances (or any portion thereof) obtained or used 
	under such circumstances.</P>
	<H2>4. ZangZing ID REQUIREMENT</H2>
	<P>In order to purchase a ZangZing Gift Certificate, you must have a valid ZangZing 
	ID. You must also have a ZangZing Wallet, which will save your credit card, 
	billing and shipping information and other information (your "Registration 
	Data"). If you do not have a ZangZing ID or a ZangZing Wallet, you will be prompted 
	to complete the registration process for them before you can pay for the 
	Services. </P>
	<P>To use ZangZing Wallet, you must provide true, accurate, and current 
	Registration Data and keep that information accurate. You, and not ZangZing, are 
	responsible for any and all purchases made through your ZangZing Wallet account or 
	in connection with your ZangZing ID. ZangZing is not responsible for unauthorized 
	purchases or errors made using your ZangZing ID or your ZangZing Wallet account. You 
	must resolve purchase-related disputes with and promptly report unauthorized use 
	of your card to your credit card company, online payment service, merchant, or 
	bank. Your liability for unauthorized use of your card may be limited by your 
	card issuer's agreement with you and/or by applicable law. In addition to the 
	uses of account information authorized by the TOS, ZangZing may access, preserve, 
	monitor and disclose your card information in the good faith belief that such 
	action is reasonably necessary to verify your account, to identify or resolve 
	problems, or to respond to inquiries about the Service, provided, however, that 
	nothing in this section shall impose a duty on ZangZing to make any such 
	disclosures. </P>

	<H2>5. FEES AND CHARGES</H2>
	<P>ZangZing may, upon notice required by applicable laws, at any time: (i) change 
	the amount of, or basis for determining, any fee or charge related to any ZangZing 
	Gift Certificate, or (ii) institute new fees or charges related to a ZangZing Gift 
	Certificate.</P>
	<H2>6. NO REFUNDS</H2>
	<P>Once your order is processed and confirmed by ZangZing, your gift certificate 
	purchase is final. You will not be able to cancel your ZangZing gift certificate 
	order, and you will not be entitled to any refunds or credits.</P>
	<H2>7. EXPIRATION</H2>
	<P>A ZangZing Gift Certificate does not expire. However, you understand and agree 
	that receipt and acceptance of the ZangZing Gift Certificate by your intended 
	recipient will be deemed to have occurred when the recipient provides their 
	consent to ZangZing to receive the gift or, in the case of a gift generating a 
	gift code, when the recipient enters the gift code associated with the ZangZing 
	Gift Certificate on to the ZangZing site and successfully applies the value 
	associated with that gift to their ZangZing account. In the unlikely event that 
	your ZangZing Gift Certificate is not received and accepted by your intended 
	recipient twelve (12) months from the date that your payment for such gift 
	certificate is finalized, then the ZangZing Gift Certificate will be applied to 
	your own ZangZing account. By way of example and not limitation, if you purchase a 
	one year ZangZing Gift Certificate and the intended recipient of the ZangZing Gift 
	Certificate does not receive and accept the one year certificate twelve (12) 
	months from the date of payment, one year of status will be added to your 
	own ZangZing account. There are presently no service fees for the maintenance of 
	unaccepted ZangZing Gift Certificates.</P>
	<H2>8. NO REPLACEMENT</H2>
	<P>ZangZing Gift Certificates will not be replaced if they are lost, stolen or 
	used without permission.</P>
	<H2>9. TERMINATION</H2>

	<P>ZangZing reserves the right to close customer accounts and request alternative 
	forms of payment if a ZangZing Gift Certificate is fraudulently obtained or used 
	on the ZangZing site.</P>
	<H2>10. PRIVACY</H2>
	<P>Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our 
	Privacy Policy. For more information, see the ZangZing Privacy Policy at <A 
	href="http://privacy.ZangZing.com/">http://privacy.ZangZing.com/</A>.</P>
	<H2>11. NO LIABILITY</H2>
	<P>A ZangZing Gift Certificate is provided "AS-IS," and ZangZing assumes no 
	responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery, misapplication or 
	failure to store any user communications personalization settings, or 
	balance.</P>
