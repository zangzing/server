      <h1>Our sincerest apologies</h1>
      <p>We are still in beta testing and our photo uploader currently requires Mac OS v10.6 or greater.</p>

      <p>
          You can still upload photos from your computer by emailing them directly into the album or
          importing them from other photo sites.
