  <h2>What is a (CVV) Credit Card Code?</h2>

	<p>
	For Visa, MasterCard, and Discover cards, the card code is the last 3 digit number 
	located on the back of your card on or above your signature line. For an American 
	Express card, it is the 4 digits on the FRONT above the end of your card number.
	</p>
  	<p>
	To help reduce fraud in the card-not-present environment, credit card companies 
	have introduced a card code program. Visa calls this code Card Verification Value
	 (CVV); MasterCard calls it Card Validation Code (CVC); Discover calls it Card ID
	 (CID). The card code is a three- or four- digit security code that is printed on 
	the back of cards. The number typically appears at the end of the signature panel.
