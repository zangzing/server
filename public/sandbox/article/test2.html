               Manfred, prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: the latter, a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda. Conrad,
               the son, was three years younger, a homely youth,m sickly, and of no promising disposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who
               never showed any symptoms of affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for his son with the marquis of Vicenza's daugher,
               Isabela; and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred, that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as
               Conrad's infirm state of health would permit. Manfred's impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and neighbours.
               The former, indeed, apprehending the severity of their prince's disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises on this precipitation.
               Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early, considering
               his great youth, and greater infirmities; but she never received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility, who had given
               him but one heir. His tenants and subjects were less cautious in their discourses: they attributed this hasty wedding to the prince's
               dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was said to have pronounced, <i>That the castle and lordship of Otranto should
               pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it.</i> It was difficult
               to make any sense of this prophecy; and still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in question.
               Yet these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere the less to their opinion.
             </p>

               Young Conrad's birth-day was fixed for his espousals. The company was assembled in the chapel of the castle, and every thing
               ready for beginning the divine office, when Conrad himself was missing. Manfred, impatient of the least delay,
               and who had not observed his son retire, dispatched one of his attendants to summon the young prince. The servant, who had not staid long enough
               to have crossed the court to Conrad's apartments, came running back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and foaming at the mouth.
               He said nothing, but pointed to the court. The company were struck with terror and amazement. The princess Hippolita, without knowing what was he matter,
               but anxious for her son, swooned away. Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the procrastination of
               the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic, asked imperiously, what was the matter? The fellow made no answer, but continued
               pointing towards the court-yard; and at last, after repeated questions put to him, cried out, Oh, the helmet! the helmet! In the mean time
               some of the company had run into the court, from whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise.
               Manfred, who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself to get information of what had occasioned this strange
               confusion. Matilda remained endeavouring to assist her mother, and Isabella staid for the same purpose, and to avoid showing
               any impatience for the bridegroom, for whom, in truth, she had conceived little affection.
