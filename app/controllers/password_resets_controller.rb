# PasswordResetsController
#
# Controls the flow of the password reset process
#
# 1.- A user clicks on the password reset link
# 2.- The new view is used to generate the form that asks for the user email
# 3.- If the email is not found, try again. If found send the email
#     Before sending the email, a one time perishable token is created and used to
#      to build the link in the email
# 4.- When the user clicks on the link, it is routed to edit and the user is fetched
#     using the perishable token as a key.
# 5.- Password is updated and user logged in.
