# Photo Model
# ï¿½ 2010, ZangZing LLC;  All rights reserved.  http://www.zangzing.com
#
# As a first implementation images are attached to photo objects using paperclip as
# performance and customization changes are required the use of paperclip can be
# revisited or we can contribute the improvements to paperclip.
#
# The way paperclip works is:
# A photo is received in a create or update request as part of a multi-part form post.
# The model assigns the photo to a paperclip attachment triggering paper clip to move the file to storage
# Then using the stored file, paperclip uses imagemagick to create the required styles.
# During the whole time, the requester is kept waiting. (This model has been updated to have async
# processing and storage of images)
#
# TODO: We should investigate the possibility of using graphicmagick instead if its faster.
#
#
# ASYNC UPLOADING AND PROCESSING
#
# To improve speed of upload, the S3 backend loading and image processing is asynchronous.
# - The photo uploaded into a tmp file by the web server.
# - The tmp photo is stored into the local_image attachment attribute which is set for local storage no styles.
# - Using an after_save callback an async call to upload_to_s3 is queued using delayed_job.
# - When the queued call is processed, the image attribute is set to local_image triggering paperclip
#   to store and process image. The image attachment is set to store in S3 with styles.
# - local_image is set to nil never to be used again =)
#
# PHOTO STATE DEFINITION AND TRANSITIONS
# -new: Default when created, has not been assigned to a photo or server
# -assigned: The photo has been created by an agent and has been assigned to it. Its waiting to be updated with an image
# -loaded: The photo has been updated with an image and is waiting to be processed
# -processing: The photo has been taken for the processing queue and its being processed
# -ready: The photo has been processed and moved to permanent storage. It is ready to use
# -deleted: The photo has been deleted and its waiting to be removed from storage.
#
# Once a photo goes assigned it needs to be updated with an image. When successful it goes loaded
# An assigned photo that is updated will trigger an async load to s3
#
# NOTES:
# The paperclip default url is used to display a temporary graphic while the local_image is processed.
# Code to accelerate a local development server was added and it may be removed for production TODO:
