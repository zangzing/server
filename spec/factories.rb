# NOTE: instead of using associations use the style shown below in :album
# where we use the after_build callback to create the associations.  We do
# this because the straight associations will create a new object without wiring
# an object graph together properly.  For instance, if you create a photo that
# in turn has an association to a user and album when the album is created it
# also has an association with a user so you end up with 2 different user objects
#
# By using the technique of calling create explicitly in the after_build callback
# we can wire things up properly because we are able to test in each factory
# whether we have already been passed the object or need to create a new one.  The
# end result is that you get what you expect which is a photo with 1 album, and 1 user
#

# By using the symbol ':user', we get Factory Girl to simulate the User model.
